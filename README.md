# Petfacts (Rust Edition)
Petfacts is a small command line utility for printing out dog or cat facts to the console, this is the rust edition.

The Python edition can be found [here](https://github.com/CodeCanna/petfacts) and has more features at the moment.  I'm working to re-write petfacts fully in Rust.

## Installation:
To install first make sure you have Cargo installed and open a console window; type `cargo install petfacts` and Cargo should take care of the rest.


## Usage
* `petfacts dog` - Print a random dog fact to the console.
* `petfacts cat` - Print a random cat fact to the console.
* `petfacts help` - Print the help screen.
* `petfacts [no args]` - Print a fact but dog or cat is chosen at random.
